Cardwolla
=========

Cardwolla is a payment router that sits between a merchant and their Credit Card gateway. It melds the ease of
use of a traditional payment card with the low-cost Dwolla network giving merchants and customers the best of
both worlds.

Try It Out!
===========

Cardwolla is live at [cardwolla.com](https://cardwolla.com). You'll just need a Dwolla account and a payment card.
Then go to [cardwolla.com/example](https://cardwolla.com/example) and give it a try. Don't worry, your card won't
be charged because it uses Stripe's sandbox.

Your Dwolla account, on the other hand, will be charged $1 if you click the "Pay $1 With Dwolla" button so only do that
if you're feeling generous.
